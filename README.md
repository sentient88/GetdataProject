Project details extracted from Coursera :

Here are the data for the project : 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following :

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##### Background information of the original data sets 

(Extracted from README file within the zip file) 

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

Note : The values of the feature variables are normalized and bounded within [-1,1]

### Project Work

In the repo 'GetdataProject', there are 3 files :

* 'run_analysis.R' - Contains the script for processing the original data sets into the tidy data set (i.e. the final output)

* 'README.md' - Provides the project background and the details of how the script in 'run.analysis.R' works.

* 'CodeBook.md' - Explains the variables in the processed tidy data set (i.e. the final output)

### Understanding 'run_analysis.R'



The script in run_analysis.R does the following :



##### For Step 1 :

- Download the zip file from the given URL

- Record the date that the zip file is being downloaded

- Unzip the zip file to the working directory

- Read the following data sets in 'train' folder in R : 'X_train.txt', 'y_train.txt', 'subject_train.txt'

- Read the following data sets in 'test' folder in R : 'X_test.txt', 'y_test.txt', 'subject_test.txt'

- Note : The files within the 'Inertial Signals' folders are not required for this project

- Extract the name of each feature variable from 'features.txt'

- Name all the columns in the data sets : 'activity', 'subject', and the corresponding feature variable name

- Merge all these data sets into a single data set with the following column order : 'activity', 'subject', and the list of 'feature variables'



##### For Step 2 :

- From the single data set in Step 1, take a subset of only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

- Note : This means that only those features with variable names that contain '-mean()' or '-std() will be extracted.  For e.g. 'tBodyAccMag-mean()' and 'fBodyAccJerk-std()-Y'

- Note : Those features with variables that contain '-meanFreq()' will be excluded.  For e.g. 'fBodyAccJerk-meanFreq()-X'

- Note : Those features with angle() variable will be excluded too.  For e.g. 'angle(tBodyGyroMean,gravityMean)'

- This will result in a smaller single data set with the following column order : 'activity', 'subject', and the reduced list of 'feature variables' for mean and standard deviation measurements only



##### For Step 3 :

- Extract the list of activity names from 'activity_labels.txt'

- Convert the activity names to lower case

- For the 'activity' column in the data set from Step 2, replace the activity code (1 to 6) with the corresponding activity name

- This will result in a similar data set as Step 2, but with descriptive activity names instead of activity codes



##### For Step 4 :

For all variable names in the data set from Step 3,

- Convert all characters to lower case

- Replace short forms with more descriptive forms : 

	* 't' (1st character) -> 'time'
	* 'f' (1st character) -> 'frequency'
	* 'acc' -> 'accelerometer'
	* 'gyro' -> 'gyroscope'
	* 'mag' -> 'magnitude' 
	* '-x' -> 'indirectionx'
	* '-y' -> 'indirectiony'
	* '-z' -> 'indirectionz'
	* '-mean' -> 'meanvalue'
	* '-std' -> 'standarddeviation'

- There are some variables with erroneous names that contain unnecessary repetition of 'body'.  For e.g. 'fBodyBodyGyroMag-mean()'.  For such cases, the variable names will be corrected to contain a single 'body' only.

- Remove '(' and ')' characters.  For e.g. 'tBodyAccMag-mean()'

- The above points will re-label the data set from Step 3 to have descriptive variable names

- Note : The resulting variable names are very long and hence may not be easy for human reading.  However, they are more descriptive than the original form which would meet the project requirements.

- Note : It is generally not recommended to have symbols in the variable names

- Note : Reference is taken from the Coursera lecture material '04_01_editingTextVariables' which recommends that the names of variables should be (i) all lower case, (ii) descriptive, and (iii) not have underscores or dots or white spaces

- Note : Please refer to CodeBook.md for a full description of each variable name



##### For Step 5 :

Note : It is required to install the 'dplyr' package  in order to run this script

- Load the library for 'dplyr'

- Group the data set from Step 4 by activity and subject

- Create a data set that computes the mean of each variable for each group

- Note : This will result in a tidy data set which meets the following criteria :

	* Each variable forms a column
	* Each observation forms a row
	* Each type of observation unit forms a table

- Note : The above criteria is referenced from the 'Tidy Data' paper by Hadley Wickham



##### For submission :

- Write the data set from Step 5 to a text file 

- Note : The file name is 'step5tidydata.txt' that will be saved in the working directory

- To view the text file in R, please refer to the last 2 lines of codes included as comments in 'run_analysis.R'
