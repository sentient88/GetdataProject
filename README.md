## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## README

Extracted from Coursera:

Here are the data for the project: 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Project Work

In the repo: GetdataProject, there are 3 files

* 'run_analysis.R' - Contains the script for processing the original data set into the processed tidy data set (i.e. the final output)

* 'README.md' - Provides the project background and the details of how the script in 'run.analysis.R' works.

* 'CodeBook.md' - Explains the variables in the processed tidy data set (i.e. final output)


==============

Note: For more information on the original data set, please refer to the README.md inside the zip file that is downloaded from the given URL.
